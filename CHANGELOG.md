# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Versions follow semver, with `-alpha.N` pre-releases until 0.1.0.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0 (unreleased)

First public build. macOS arm64 only, ad-hoc signed, not notarized.

- Topics instead of a notification pile: an agent groups PRs into topics and keeps a dossier per topic. Renames and merges are proposals you accept.
- Queues (Needs reply, My PRs, Team's PRs, To review, Team mentioned) that hold topics, with tiles that say for whom, why now, what state and whose move.
- Stacks stay together as one unit; agent-grouped sets for related PRs.
- Per-PR glances (verdict and risk) with sources, recheck and forget.
- Live notification poll with Mac notifications for pings that are your move.
- GitHub stays the source of truth for read/unread. Writes (approve, comment, mark read) sit behind a lock, and queued mark-reads have an undo window.
- `instructions.md` for your own rules, changed only by hand or through accepted proposals.
- Daily work context sweep over `~/.claude` with secret masking and a skip list (default `taxes,garden,hobby,personal,private`, set `POSTPILE_SWEEP_SKIP` to change it).
- About box with version, Help links to the repo and issues.
- FYI for anyone who ran a pre-release build: the bundle id changed from `com.postpile.app` to `com.posthog.postpile`, so macOS asks for notification permission again. Data stays in `~/Library/Application Support/PostPile`.
